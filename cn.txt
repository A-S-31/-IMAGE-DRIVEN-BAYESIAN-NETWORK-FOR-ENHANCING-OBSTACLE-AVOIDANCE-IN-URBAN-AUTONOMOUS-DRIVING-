The address **2404:6800:4009:823::200e** shown in the ping output is an **IPv6 address**. Specifically, it is the **IPv6 address of a server** (in this case, Google's server). Here's a breakdown of the components:

### 1. **IPv6 Address**
   - The address **2404:6800:4009:823::200e** is written in the **IPv6 format**, which is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (`:`).
   - The address you see is composed of a series of hexadecimal numbers, and the `::` indicates that one or more groups of zeros have been compressed for brevity.

### 2. **What is it Called?**
   - **IPv6 Address of Google’s Server**: In this case, the address represents one of Google's servers (likely part of their content delivery network or DNS servers). 
   - The format `2404:6800:4009:823::200e` suggests that it's an **IPv6 address** of a **Google service**.

### Breaking it Down:
- **2404:6800:4009:823::200e** is the **IPv6 address** of a Google server, and it uses the address block assigned to Google (often indicated by ranges like `2404:6800::/32`).
- The address is part of Google's IPv6 address range, which they use to serve their websites and services over IPv6.

### In General Terms:
- **IPv6 Address**: This is the new generation of IP addresses that is designed to replace IPv4, which is running out of available addresses. IPv6 allows for a much larger address space.
- **Server IP Address**: This address is a unique identifier for a device (server) on a network. In this case, it’s one of Google's servers.

### Example Context:
- When you ping **google.com**, the command resolves the domain name to an IP address. If the server supports IPv6, the address might be an IPv6 address (like the one shown in your example).
- In this case, the `2404:6800:4009:823::200e` is likely one of Google's content delivery servers, accessed using IPv6.

### Summary:
The **2404:6800:4009:823::200e** is an **IPv6 address** representing one of Google's servers. Specifically, it’s a **public IPv6 address** used by Google's infrastructure to serve web traffic.
